              I&apos;m Joseph and I love turning the unknown into the known. My curiosity and wonder drives me and lately I&apos;ve developed a passion for building smart, scalable data pipelines. My focus is applying NLP to text data turning it into valuable insights.

              My journey began during a gap year where I discovered my love for finance through MIT&apos;s Opencourseware. This led me to Finance, then Math, then Coding. Soon I was blending my interests in Math, Finance, and Coding into building meaningful products.

            <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Since then, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on exciting projects: building data systems for Major League Baseball, developing text classification systems for research grants, and streamlining processes at a $1B hedge fundâ€”saving researchers hours each week through automation.

              Now, as I complete my mathematics degree with a focus on data science and statistics, I&apos;m driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through data-driven solutions.
