    description: 'Developed an AI-powered pipeline for a +$1B AUM Quant Hedge Fund to extract insightful topic from noisy data. The pipeline automates the processing and classification of large financial text datasets, reducing manual workload by 90% and cutting costs by 70% per dataset. Used semantic embeddings, clustering models (HDBSCAN, K-Means), and multi-AI consensus scoring to extract key insights for trading strategies. Built an interactive web platform for exploring data, enhancing research speed and accuracy.',

    description: 'Conducted research on predicting the movement of epitaphs in 1-4 AD Rome to help archaeologists identify potential epitaph locations. Developed a Markov chain model with network analysis of ancient Roman road and waterway systems using Python, NumPy, and scikit-learn. Collaborated with an Professor Zehavi Husser , creating heatmaps and interactive visualizations to reveal distribution patterns. Proposed backpropagation to refine the model, although time constraints limited full implementation. Key takeaway: A stationary markov matrix for network analysis',

Each of the 200+ entries contained approximately 15 individual items, requiring classification. A task that would have taken an estimated 125 hours (nearly 16 full workdays) to complete manually was reduced to just 7 minute with automation. This significantly reduced analysis time and cost, allowing the research team to quickly derive actionable insights and focus on higher-level analysis.",

    description: 'Engineered and implemented a sophisticated XML parsing system using Python and xmltree to efficiently process a large dataset of 14,000 data points for archaeological research. Developed a robust validation process to ensure data integrity, crafting test data to expose and correct parsing errors. Identified and resolved a critical bug related to data redundancy in XML files, which had been overlooked during initial sampling due to unique dataset characteristics. This involved implementing conditional processing logic to handle varying data point lengths within XML files, ensuring accurate data extraction across the entire dataset. By automating the data engineering process, I reduced the time required to process 14,000 data points from an estimated 817 hours (manually) to just over 20 minutes. This not only improved efficiency but also allowed the research team to focus more on analyzing data, significantly accelerating the projectâ€™s timeline and contributing to its overall success',
